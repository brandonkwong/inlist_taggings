# InList Feature: Taggings

### Taggings
Users are able to create items and assign tags to that item through a taggings join table. Users are able to then search for items based on the tags they are associated with. If a tag is added to an item, and it already exists in the database, that existing tag is assigned to the item. Otherwise, a new tag is created and then assigned to the item.
