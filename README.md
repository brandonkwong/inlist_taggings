# InList Feature: Taggings

### Taggings
Users are able to create items and assign tags to that item through a taggings join table. If a tag is added to an item, and it already exists in the database, that existing tag is assigned to the item. Otherwise, a new tag is created and then assigned to the item. By consuming the API, users are able to then search for items based on the tags they are associated with.
